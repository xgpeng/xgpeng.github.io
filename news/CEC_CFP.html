<p style="font-size: inherit; color: inherit; line-height: inherit; padding: 0px; margin: 1.5em 0px;">Organized by Xingguang Peng, Yaqing Hou, and Yew-Soon Ong</p>
<h2 id="hscopeandtopics" style="color: inherit; line-height: inherit; padding: 0px; margin: 1.5em 0px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.4em;"><span style="font-size: inherit; color: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Scope and Topics</span></h2>
<p style="font-size: inherit; color: inherit; line-height: inherit; padding: 0px; margin: 1.5em 0px;">Multi-agent systems (MAS) are computerized systems composing of multiple interacting and autonomous agents within a common environment of interest for problem-solving. The development of intelligent agents that are capable of adapting to the complex or dynamic environment has attracted increasing attentions over the past decades. In computational intelligence, evolutionary computation (EC), in particular, has been shown to provide a reliable and flexible contender over traditional mathematical approaches for solving complex optimization problems, especially if near global optimum solutions are sought. According to the recent studies, EC based techniques, including evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, evolutionary reinforcement and transfer learning, are already starting to show up in developing more significant intelligence among multiple agents in MAS. Particularly, the intrinsic parallelism of natural evolution and the errors which are introduced due to the physiological limits of the agents’ ability to perceive differences, could generate the “growth” and “variation” of knowledge that agents have of the world, thus exhibiting high adaptivity capabilities on solving complex and non-trivial problems. </p>
<p style="font-size: inherit; color: inherit; line-height: inherit; padding: 0px; margin: 1.5em 0px;">Taking this cue, the present special session aims at bringing together researchers from both academia and industry to explore the recent developments, future directions and the potential challenges in this field.
